# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was created to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

D3 library was used to build the data.

  # Plotly-Charts developed

1. Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu that displays the top 10 OTUs found in that individual (id).

2. Bubble chart that displays each sample.

3. Gauge chart with the weekly washing frequency of the individual (Bonus).

  # Table
1. Individual demographic information


  # Dropdown
1. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
